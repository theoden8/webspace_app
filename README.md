# Webspace App

Webspace is a Flutter app that empowers users to carry AI-based tools right in their pockets. With the ability to run multiple webviews in a single app, it offers a convenient and efficient way to manage multiple web-based applications. Written almost entirely using GPT-4 ([transcript](./transcript/0-gpt4-coding.md)) in a span of a few hours, Webspace is a testament to the power of cutting-edge technology in delivering innovative solutions. This app offers users to rapidly adapt to a universe of new tools as soon as they are released, freeing them from the constraints of non-free or open-source apps' development schedules or using web-browsers for that purpose. It's like a spacecraft that can take users on a journey of discovery, enabling them to explore new horizons and get closer to cutting-edge AI technologies. Whether you're a student conducting research on-the-go, a developer testing web applications, or a curious individual expanding your horizons, Webspace is the perfect companion to keep in your pocket.

## Features

- Multi-webview support: You can add and manage multiple webviews in a single app.
- Customizable webviews: You can set custom settings for each webview.
- Dark mode support: The app supports both light and dark modes, which can be switched dynamically.

## Getting Started

To use Webspace, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Android Studio or VS Code).
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies.
4. Connect your mobile device to your computer and run the app using `flutter run --flavor fmain`.

## Usage

To add a new webview, click the "Add Site" or the big green button button in the app, then enter the URL for the webview. You can also customize the order of the webviews by dragging and dropping them in the desired order.

To switch between webviews, simply tap on the webview you want to view, and it will be displayed in the main view. You can also close a webview by swiping it to the left or right.
