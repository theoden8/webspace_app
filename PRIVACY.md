# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 2026**

## Overview

WebSpace is an open source app that helps you organize your favorite websites into workspaces. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how the app handles your data.

**In short: WebSpace stores all data locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or have access to any of your data.**

## Data Storage

### What WebSpace Stores Locally

All data is stored exclusively on your device:

- **Sites and Webspaces**: The URLs and names of websites you add
- **Site Settings**: Per-site preferences (language, proxy, user agent, etc.)
- **Cookies**: Website cookies, stored securely and isolated per-site
- **App Settings**: Theme preferences and other app configuration
- **Cached Icons**: Website favicons for display purposes

### Where Data is Stored

- Data is stored in the app's private storage area on your device
- Cookies are stored using secure, encrypted storage
- No data is stored on external servers

## Data Collection

**WebSpace does not collect any data.** Specifically:

- No analytics or tracking
- No crash reporting to external services
- No advertising or ad tracking
- No user accounts or registration
- No data transmitted to our servers (we don't have any)

## Third-Party Services

### Websites You Visit

When you use WebSpace to browse websites:

- Those websites may collect data according to their own privacy policies
- WebSpace acts as a web browser and displays content from websites you choose to visit
- Cookies from websites are stored locally and isolated per-site
- WebSpace does not inject tracking or modify website content (except for optional theme injection you control)

### No Third-Party SDKs

WebSpace does not include:

- Analytics SDKs
- Advertising SDKs
- Crash reporting SDKs
- Social media SDKs

## Data Sharing

**WebSpace does not share any data** because:

- All data stays on your device
- We have no servers to receive data
- We have no partnerships that involve data sharing

## Your Control

You have full control over your data:

- **Delete cookies**: Clear cookies for any site at any time
- **Remove sites**: Delete any site and its associated data
- **Export/Import**: Back up your settings to a file you control
- **Uninstall**: Removing the app deletes all associated data

## Security

- Cookies are stored using platform-secure storage (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android)
- Per-site cookie isolation prevents cross-site tracking within the app
- All data remains on your device

## Children's Privacy

WebSpace does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app provides unrestricted web access, so parental guidance is recommended.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the new version in our GitHub repository and update the "Last updated" date.
